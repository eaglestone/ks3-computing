# Developing a new computing scheme of work for Key Stage 3

*Note: This scheme of work is a draft in response to the publication of the consultation National Curriculum for maintained schools in England  issued in February 2013.  As such it is a work in progress and likely to change.  It is also incomplete: my intention is to iteratively develop units having tested ideas with my classes, consulted colleagues and watched the ongoing debate develop.*

## Syllabus Content

The syllabus is composed of three main elements: computational thinking; computers and networks (for want of a better word or phrase), and digital literacy (again for want of a better phrase).

### Computational thinking

This has four elements:

1.  **Decomposition**: breaking problems and tasks down into discrete, manageable steps
2.  **Patterns**: Recognising patterns, common features, similarities and differences as a basis for problem solving.
3.  **Abstraction**: Representing ideas, processes, relationships and data in general terms. This also entails deciding what not to include when developing models or solutions..
4.  **Algorithms**: Producing a step-by-step strategy to solve a problem.

### Computers and networks

From the draft Programme of Study for Computing (Feb 2013), this section covers:

5.  **Computer systems**: Understanding the hardware and software components that make up networked computer systems, how they interact, and how they affect cost and performance. How instructions are stored and executed.
6.  **Networks and the Internet**: Explaining how networks such as the internet work and their characteristics. Analyze how networks affect the user and understand issues of e-safety.
7.  **Control**: Understand how computers can monitor and control physical systems.

### Digital Literacy

Again from the draft Programme of Study this involves:

8.  **Project management**: Undertaking creative projects that involve selecting, using, and combining multiple applications, preferably across a range of devices, to achieve challenging goals, including collecting and analysing data and meeting the needs of known users.
9.  **IT Skills**: Being able to create, reuse, revise and repurpose digital information and content with attention to design, intellectual property and audience.

In addition to the draft Programme of Study:

10.  **Information literacy**: Understanding validity and bias on the Internet. Explaining the differece between data, information and knowledge. Managing personal information and your digital footprint.

## Curriculum Structure

In line with some current thinking (Bjork, TO DO ADD REF), the course is structured in a way that facilities the interleaving of key concepts as they cut across several units. Hence, the scheme of work can be read as a series of ‘units’ that give students the opportunity to experience a range of different packages, computer languages and topics. But cutting across these units are key concepts such as ‘decomposition’’ or ‘logic’ that are repeatedly met in differing contexts (the units) in order to support the concept of spacing (Bjork, 2012 ADD REF).

## Pitching the course

With the disapplication of the ICT programme and study and publication of the draft Programme of Study, we have the opportunity to pitch our scheme of work and lessons to our local needs.  



Most of our students typically come in to year 7 at roughly level 4 in ICT to use the old money. This is despite of what was recorded and reported or their attainment in the SATs.  At our school, we are currently aiming for progression to the OCR Computing GCSE and the Cambridge iGCSE in IT.  I will use the OCR course and the old APP as a benchmark for progression from year 7 to 9 in the absence of any additional guidance or statutory requirements.



We offer the OCR Computing GCSE as a two year course in years 10 and 11.  From the OCR Spec (July 2012):

#### Grade F

1.  Candidates recall, select and communicate a basic knowledge and understanding computer hardware, software and other related technologies.
2.  They identify, with guidance, the information relevant to solve them from the context of the problem.
3.  They apply limited knowledge, understanding and skills to design and implement basic computer programs which solve these problems. In their solutions they use simple models, collect some necessary data, use simple instructions to process the data and present the results.
4.  They sometimes review their work and provide comments on how they and others use computer technology to solve problems and make simple modifications to improve their work.
5.  Candidates demonstrate some awareness of the need for safe, secure and responsible practices. 
6.  They use ICT to communicate, demonstrating limited awareness of purpose and audience.

#### Grade C

1.  Candidates recall, select and communicate a good knowledge and understanding of the function, application merits and implications of a range of computer hardware, software and other related technologies.
2.  They analyse problems, identifying and collecting some information relevant to solve them from the context of the problem. They apply knowledge, understanding and skills to design and implement computer programs which solve these problems. In their solutions, they model situations, acquire a input data, sequence instructions, manipulate and process data and present the results of the processing in a mostly appropriate format.
3.  They review their work and evaluate the way they and others use computer technology to solve problems and make improvements on their work where appropriate.
4.  Candidates work using safe, secure and responsible practices. They use ICT to communicate, demonstrating consideration of purpose and audience.

#### Grade A

1.  Candidates recall, select and communicate a thorough knowledge and understanding of the function, application, merits and implications of a broad range of computer hardware, software and other related technologies.
2.  They systematically analyse problems, identifying and collecting the information required to solve them from the context of the problem. They apply knowledge, understanding and skills to design and implement effective computer programs which solve these problems. In their solutions, they effectively model situations, acquire and validate input data, sequence instructions, manipulate and process data and present the results of the processing in an appropriate format.
3.  They work systematically and critically evaluate the way they and others use computer technology to solve problems. They iteratively review their work and make improvements where appropriate.
4.  Candidates work systematically and understand and adopt safe, secure and responsible practices.They use ICT to communicate effectively, demonstrating a clear sense of purpose and audience.



Comparing the above statements to the previous National Curriculum levels and, specifically, the Assessing Pupil Progress guidance, it appears as though the Grade C descriptors align closest with level 7; Grade F looks as though it aligns to the level 4 to 5 crossover; and Grade A is Exceptional Performance. 

## Assessment 

At the time of writing, we are still waiting for guidance and clarification on assessment and measures of progression. This section is likely to change in due course.

### Ongoing assessment

The each unit has a column marked ‘performance’ that lists a set of activities that might be useful when inferring learning. As such, they could be used as the basis of assessment for learning activities or sources of immediate feedback when planning individual lessons.

### End of unit assessment

Assessment at the end of each unit will have to aims: identify what students have remembered, and their ability to apply their learning in new ways.

I am grateful to the following sources who have published material freely that has informed my thinking.  This is not an exhaustive list



The Learning Spy – David Didau: For me, David Didau is a teacher’s teacher and seems really on top of his game.  I have been stalking him online for a while as we seem to be at similar stages in our reflections on what we do. David is far more eloquent, articulate and giving of what he does than me. Thank you.

CS Priciples( National Science Foundation): Computer Science: Principles is a new course under development that seeks to broaden participation in computing and computer science. Development is being led by a team of computer science educators organized by the College Board and the National Science Foundation. Pilots are ongoing at the high school and college levels. Advanced Placement credit is not currently offered for this course-- present efforts in CS Principles are part of the requisite process to make it an AP course. The test will debut in May 2016 or later.
