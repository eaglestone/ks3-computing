#Kodu—medium term plan

_Year 7, Length: 6 weeks_

##Learning objectives
The lesson overview and example lesson plans below are just a guide. Plans should be tailored for each class.  However, the objectives below should be covered as a minimum during this unit of work.

####Level 4:
Analyse and tackle problems by:
-decomposing them into smaller parts 
-using logical reasoning to explain simple algorithms

Develop solutions to problems by: 
-designing, writing and debugging procedures that accomplish specific goals
-using sequences, selection and repetition to implement algorithms

####Level 5
Problem solve and model situations and processes by:
-tracing flowcharts, state machines and other diagrams to explain how a process or model works

Produce algorithms by: 
-creating precise and accurate sequences of instructions
-tracing and explaining code in textual and diagrammatic languages

####What happened last lesson?

N/A Lesson 1 on Kodu

####Groups/ individuals to consider _in this particular lesson_
SEE SEATING PLAN AND TEACHER PLANNER|

####Bell work
Logon and go to desks. Show the working Kodu game on the screen. Question on board (in pen): what are the rules of this game?|

####Progress map
What do I want the students to learn this lesson? 

1.	To be able to implement simple algorithm in Kodu so that they become familiar with programming it

2.	To be able to know the parts of an Activity chart so that they can start to abstract algorithms away from a specific implementation

####**Outline of the activities & questions that will challenge the different abilities to make at least good progress in this lesson**|

1.	Discuss the answer to the bell work question and explain Kodu

2.	In tables, SLIDE 2: come up with best answers

3.	Demo Kodu: make a world. Raise and lower land; textures; objects;

4.	Refer to SLIDE 2 and implement. Give time for play and support

5.	In tables: Show Activity charts. Describe what’s going on.

6.	Handout 1: 1 big copy per table. Complete the meaning column and take in whole-class suggestions.

7.	Copy in best into books (print small versions 1 per student and stick)|

####Activity to ensure that you and the students know they have made good progress

1.	Practical: make the world and it works on Kodu

2.	Theory: can complete the Activity Chart table in books|

####Homework
None
